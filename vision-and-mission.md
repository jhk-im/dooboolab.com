# Vision and Mission

`dooboolab` wishes to help out those who are in trouble of making better society. We are a group of experts who contribute to various platforms and open source projects to work publicly for creating benefits.

1. We wish to get connected with great people who meet our vision, which is making a better society.
2. If you have faced any problem in your boundary when trying to do some innovative things, please tell us your stories and be with us. Make sure that you meet our `code of conduct` below.

3. Our Standard is to make a reasonable society which we know that it's hard to make it as a standard. However, we will try to communicate with many others, share experience and try to spread out things that are considered to be right.
    - Note that we all acknowledge that the `standard` or the `right` can be changed as we bring more `experience` and `stories`.
4. We wish to grow together with multiple stakeholders working for different things.
    - Therefore, if anyone needs our help or be with us as a partner, please contact us.
5. Since bringing the standard is why we are working for, we only participate on the `public` work (no `private`).
6. We want to grow to become a strong open source community for individuals, companies, and group of societies.
    - We will bring transparent relationships (including financials) for our works.
7. Finally, we want to become a just society.
